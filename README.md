# Hype's Utilities

## Prerequisites
- CS2 Server (Of course)
- Metamod Installed
- CounterStrikeSharp Installed

## Installation Guide

Extract the zip you downloaded into your CounterStrikeSharp plugins folder
This can be located at:
`<server folder>/game/csgo/addons/counterstrikesharp/plugins`

**You will need an existing MySQL server to run this plugin.**

That's it! All you have to do is run your server.

## Claiming ownership 
Once you're in the server, you will need to run the command `!iamgod` to claim your ownership role. Once that's done, you have owner permissions. Although you'll have to relog to claim the tag visually.
